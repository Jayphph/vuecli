                    <p>
                    After listening to the markets and proving the business model with the Saas SDK and VisioMapEditor thanks to steady sales of licenses, Visioglobe leadership decided to develop new products. After a couple of POC in order to test the markets, almost all of them where put to production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The main problem was to make them reachable and to create app√©tence for the users and clients in order to sell new licenses. So we decided to create the My.visioglobe hub with the goal to make the products and features self-marketed and self served for recurring and new clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    At first we did a big survey of all kind of product hubs, starting with A players but also looking in other industries alltogether.
